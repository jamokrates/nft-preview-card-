### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned 

-In this challenge I learned that you have to override the margin and padding. Sometimes different web browsers have different default settings. So by setting it to zero you can move forward and you won't have to deal with any white space around your project. I also learned that it can be good practice to add prefix for each of the web browsers so your project can look the same on any of them (excluding Internet Explorer because it's now extinct. :( )


### Continued development

-I really want to learn how to better use icon libraries so I could add some more spice to whatever project i'm working on. Throughout this project I made a lot of html comments so myself and anyone else could get a better understanding of each piece. I look forward to understanding CSS further and learning the different tricks.
